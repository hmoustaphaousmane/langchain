# Blendle's Employee Handbook

This is a living document with everything we've learned working with people while running a startup. And, of course, we continue to learn. Therefore it's a document that will continue to change. 

**Everything related to working at Blendle and the people of Blendle, made public.**

These are the lessons from three years of working with the people of Blendle. It contains everything from [how our leaders lead](https://www.notion.so/ecfb7e647136468a9a0a32f1771a8f52?pvs=21) to [how we increase salaries](https://www.notion.so/Salary-Review-e11b6161c6d34f5c9568bb3e83ed96b6?pvs=21), from [how we hire](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-451bbcfe8d9b49438c0633326bb7af0a?pvs=21) and [fire](https://www.notion.so/Firing-5567687a2000496b8412e53cd58eed9d?pvs=21) to [how we think people should give each other feedback](https://www.notion.so/Our-Feedback-Process-eb64f1de796b4350aeab3bc068e3801f?pvs=21) — and much more.

We've made this document public because we want to learn from you. We're very much interested in your feedback (including weeding out typo's and Dunglish ;)). Email us at hr@blendle.com. If you're starting your own company or if you're curious as to how we do things at Blendle, we hope that our employee handbook inspires you.
